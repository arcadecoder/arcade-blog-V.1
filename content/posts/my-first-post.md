I've been operating under the grave misconsception that Data Analysis is all about the software and programming languages and the skill to do fancy, impressive coding to reach a result. Over the many years I have been in studying in academia research was always focused on the hypothesis, why are you investigating? what are the assumptions you want to prove or disprove? What is the question. It took me a while to put the two together, data analsysis is the using the data to answer a question and computer science is simply the tools to do so.

Data analysis is the process in which raw data is ordered and organised to be used in methods that help to evalue and explain the past and predict the future. It's about posing questions and trying to answer them. For someone with anxiety, who feels overwhelmed with all the possibilities of the future, and decision paralysis. It finally seemed that this might be perfect?

However, therein lies a dilemma. Anxiety also comes with a fear of saying or doing stupid things. A fear of asking questions. Paradoxical right? The very essence and begining of analysis is to ask questions.
