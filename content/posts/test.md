The Fibonacci’s sequence is a common algorithm featured in many coding tests that are used for interviewing and assessing aspiring developers. Fear not, the name is more daunting than the actual solution which I discovered after several days of doubting my ability to code — imposter syndrome and anxiety takes no prisoners in tech.


As part of my learning journey into programming and long-standing desire to work in bioinformatics, I have been working through coding problems on the computational biology website Rosalind. Rosalind is a project that aims to teach programming skills in the context of biological sciences through a series of problem-solving algorithms.

“Rabbits and Recurrence relations” is the fourth problem in the bioinformatics stronghold. It bears heavy similarity to the Fibonacci sequence algorithm which is often used in many coding interviews and assessments. Part if a good learning technique and test of reinforced knowledge is being able to explain what you have just learnt.
